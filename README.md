Project web portfolio

Discover my first "Web" project. 
Creating a portfolio website was a personal goal as I approached the internships linked to my course of study. I wanted to build a site that was original, clear and informative for visitors. 
Thanks to numerous tools such as Bootstrap and Sass, I was able to develop this site while facilitating the integration of certain components (completely adaptive) and its maintenance.
